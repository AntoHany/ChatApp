### Simple explanation

Actually I used React as a front end and it is obviously a great UI library and the best thing about it is that you can control the entire site without reloading the page and this is done via virtual dom


On the back end, I used Express by creating some routes to fetch and send data.


I also use MongoDB as a database.


In order to make the program a real-time application, I used Socket IO, which is a library through which you send the data sent from the server without any HTTP requests.

[Take a look](https://chat-app-ten-eta-66.vercel.app/)

If you go in to look at this program it is not a real time application and this is because I am displaying it on Versel and it does not respond to real time applications
